# MATSim playgrounds

Please note that playgrounds are slowly being outphased and re-factorings for changes in the core may not always happen. 
Playgrounds where the owner has no commits within a year will be removed in a regular interval. 

*As decided at the 2017 developer meeting, a re-factoring of playgrounds is no longer obligatory. The playground repository will move to read-only access in late spring 2018*
